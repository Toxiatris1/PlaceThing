# Intro
A collabrative pixel art site where users start off with 5(*) pixels. Every minute(*), users will gain a new pixel to place down on a 1000x1000 grid. Every 12(*) hours the gridstate is saved as the next frame in a gif. The last frame will be transparently underlayed to make it easier for animations to be finished.

# Team
Me, myself, and I

# Project Objectives
Create a collabrative pixel art site that turns 12(*) hour runs into an animated gif.

Implement botting countermeasures (eg Captcha/Advanced account creation techniques)
